## About the Project

This repository contains the project deliverables for the Blockchain and Cryptocurrency course (SSC0958), focusing on implementing a system for enhanced trust and transparency in green certifications using blockchain technology.

### Project Overview

This project aims to address the issue of trust and authenticity in green seals or ecological certifications.  Currently, consumers often struggle to verify the legitimacy of green claims made by products and services. This project proposes a blockchain-based solution to register and verify green certifications, providing a transparent and tamper-proof record of their issuance.

### Project Description

The core components of this project include:

1. **Problem Definition:**  The project identifies the existing conflict of interest between consumers seeking genuinely sustainable products and industries sometimes making misleading or unsubstantiated green claims.  It emphasizes the need for a reliable system to verify the authenticity of green certifications.

2. **Proposed Solution:**  The project proposes using blockchain technology to create a decentralized, immutable, and transparent database of green certifications.  This allows consumers and other stakeholders to easily verify the validity of a product's green seal.

3. **Implementation Details:**  The chosen platform for implementation is Ethereum, due to its mature ecosystem, available tools, and support for smart contracts. A smart contract was developed to manage the registration and verification of green seals.  The contract handles the following processes:
    * Registration of new green certifications by issuing authorities.
    * Verification of certifications by consumers or other interested parties.
    * Tracking of the lifecycle of a certification, including updates and revocations.

4. **Scope and Limitations:** The project focuses specifically on the implementation of the smart contract for certification management. It does not include a cryptocurrency component or a complex voting system to avoid increasing the project's complexity unnecessarily.  The project also acknowledges limitations of blockchain technology, such as scalability and sustainability concerns, particularly regarding energy consumption.

5. **Alternative Solutions:**  The project compares the proposed blockchain-based system with existing solutions like B Corporation, Energy Star, and FSC certifications, highlighting the potential for enhanced transparency and trust that blockchain offers.

6. **Code and Documentation:** The smart contract code is provided in this repository.  It consists of 316 lines of code divided into 9 different files.  The code is functional and provides a basic, usable implementation of the certification management system.  Further development could integrate the system with a web platform for improved user access.

7. **Future Directions:** The project envisions a future where blockchain technology can play a key role in resolving conflicts of interest between industry and consumers regarding environmental responsibility, leading to a more sustainable and prosperous future.


### Key Features & Requirements:

* **Transparency and Security:** Utilizes blockchain's inherent properties to ensure transparent and secure certification management.
* **Decentralization:** Eliminates the need for a central authority, reducing the risk of manipulation or fraud.
* **Immutability:** Guarantees the integrity of certification records, preventing tampering or alteration.
* **Ethereum Integration:** Leverages the Ethereum platform for smart contract execution and management.
* **Practical Implementation:**  Provides a functional implementation of the core certification management features.
